SAY;You decide to check out the Everfree. It can't be that bad, I mean, the ponies are pussies anyways. It can't be that bad.... right? R-right?
SAY;
SAY;Well, now that you're here, you can definitely see that, yes, it is exactly that bad. There's a constant, cartoon cliche of something watching you, and the trees seem to shift, trying to pull you in deeper.
SAY;Thanks to the fucking trees you also, embarassingly, seem to have lost the pathway. After some ambling about, you stumble upon the cream pony you met yesterday, along with a yellow pony you assume is Fluttershy.
SAY;The yellow Pony, upon spotting you, freezes and bolts down a dirt path. When Roseluck sees you she jumps back a little, but regains her composure quickly. She still looks a little flustered, but not frightened like her friend.
SAY;Roseluck: Oh, wow, uhm....hi? Uhm, sorry I just... How's it going Anonymous? I'm just picking flowers with my friend Fluttershy. So much for the 'buddy system'. So, how's Ponyville treatin' ya?
